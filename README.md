# Clip-And-Zip-Geodata

# DESCRIPION:This application was developed by the VT Center for Geographic Information (Steve Sharp) based on a sample set of code available from the Esri developer site.  The goal of the app is to provide end-user the ability to "clip and zip" certain dataset available from Vermont's Open Geodata Portal.  The application includes two primary components 1) Frontend HTML/Javascript app which allows the user to visualize the data, define an area of interest (AOI), then request a "clipped and zipped" extract. The 2) Backend handles the frontend "clip and zip" request via and ArcGIS Server "geoprocessing service" built with python (originally based on Esri sample and modified to meet VCGI's needs).
